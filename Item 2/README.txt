We created a method to reject every existing application for a certain fixuptask when an application of that fix-up task is accepted and gets a credit card.
With this, we make sure that the rest of applications show as rejected while just one is accepted.

In this folder we provide two differents projects. Acme-Handy-Worker is ready to be deployed by Pre-production virtual box and Acme-Handy-Worker (CleverCloud) is ready to be deployed by CleverCloud. We decided to do this because we made changes in the code (reflected in the Change report document) and we wanted to provide both versions, with and without the data.xml (and pom.xml dependency) modified.
